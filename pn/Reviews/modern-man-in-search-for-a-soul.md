# üìí Summary + Notes

In the book Carl Jung talks about diverse range of topics.  
As person grows, matures and ages, their interaction with the environemnt changes. They need to develop mental models to fit into society (that is the envirnment for a human), and most of the times it happens naturally. 
Jung uses nature's cycle as a metaphor: Spring Summer Autumn and Fall, to distinguish four major life crises a human expected to have in lifetime. 
Healthy development occurs on its own, but how things can go wrong?
When a person has mental models that do not reflect the world, their expectations are often wrong. This causes frustration. The useful way is to reflect on the self: after all, it seems that the only thing a person can change is themself. However there is often a simpler way: to blame something. Finding a reason to feel justified in one's own frustration starts a vicious cycle, and it takes an individual further from reality. Seeking therapy is one of the ways people are able to solve this. 
The problems in modern therapy, probably, changed significantly since Jung's time, but some things remain. Transference is when a client still do not accept responsibiity for their life and visits therapist regularly and often for the dose of feeling better in the process. Jung's approach is different. On one side, he understood things that later will become known as angst, existentialism, dasein, throwness, and futility of searching for the panacea: no matter what crises will exist, people will go through tough times, and face difficult life situations. So a therapist is a minister often, who can't really help a person but say "hold on and this will pass"; but most importantly therapist is a teacher and a guide, a person who teaches their clients to become their own ministers.
